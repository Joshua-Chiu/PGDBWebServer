## Things that should be fixed at some point

- [ ] modular non hard-coded way of making awards/pins and point catagories so more can be added/removed easily
- [ ] fix last modified date on Student so it updates when points are added
- [ ] have the archive thing import/export plists
- [ ] make the Points constructor create PointCodes if missing
- [ ] in xml make ids of objects attributes instead of child tags e.g. `<student student_num=1234>`, `<grade grade=12>`
- [ ] allow search to filter by T1 or T2 averages greater than a value
- [ ] allow students to be kept in the database but marked as inactive so they don't show up in searches or other stuff unless it's explicitly enabled in the search
- [ ] make a button to download pgdb file archive of students and delete them at the same time
- [ ] make sure incorrect inputs from users like files or forms don't cause crashes
- [ ] when doing searches avoid python for-loops and properties; try to use sql queries instead
