A database custom built for PGSS for managing and storing student information for generating award recipients.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

System packages:
* Python â‰¥ 3.6
* mariaDB, MySQL or PostgresSQL

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Create the PGDB database
```
create databse PGDB;
```

Create user in the SQL database
```
CREATE USER 'pgadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '2.718281';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON PGDB.* TO 'pgadmin'@'localhost';
```

Install all python dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Migrate columns to your SQL database
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the development server
```
python manage.py runserver

## Todo list

- [ ] modular non hard-coded way of making awards/pins and point catagories so more can be added/removed easily
- [ ] fix last modified date on Student so it updates when points are added
- [ ] have the archive thing import/export plists
- [ ] make the Points constructor create PointCodes if missing
- [ ] in xml make ids of objects attributes instead of child tags e.g. `<student student_num=1234>`, `<grade grade=12>`
- [ ] allow search to filter by T1 or T2 averages greater than a value
- [ ] allow students to be kept in the database but marked as inactive so they don't show up in searches or other stuff unless it's explicitly enabled in the search
- [ ] make a button to download pgdb file archive of students and delete them at the same time
- [ ] make sure incorrect inputs from users like files or forms don't cause crashes
- [ ] when doing searches avoid python for-loops and properties; try to use sql queries instead

## Helpful Information

WDB .csv:

* only known way to convert to csv is to open in libreoffice
* convert the csv to pgdb with converter.py
* must contain only one grade

Students enter the system through:

* admin creation
* admin csv import (students only)
* .pgdb upload (students and their points)
* test data adding script

Points enter the system through:

* .pgdb import
* student_info page entry
* direct entry
* direct entry csv upload
