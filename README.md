## Things that should be fixed at some point

- [ ] turn homeroom attribute in student class into 2 seperate grade and homeroom attributes and make homeroom a string for special classes

- [ ] allow search to filter by T1 or T2 averages greater than a value
- [ ] see list of actions by different users
- [ ] allow students to be kept in the database but marked as inactive so they don't show up in searches or other stuff unless it's explicitly enabled
- [ ] allow exporting of students from search page like admin csv export

- [x] make archive page not ugly
- [ ] make converter.py create start year for students missing it by taking the average of students with a start year and allow an optional grade argument for wdb_convert
- [ ] make a button to download pgdb file archive of students and delete them at the same time
- [x] change all tsv import and export to csv
- [ ] add dashboard features like recent changes and statistics

- [ ] make anecdotes work
