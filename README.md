## Things that should be fixed at some point

- [ ] turn homeroom attribute in student class into 2 seperate grade and homeroom attributes and make homeroom a string for special classes
- [ ] remove that giant js library from the repo
- [ ] make creating a student from admin acutally work and make grade objects for it
- [ ] modular non hard-coded way of making awards/pins and point catagories so more can be added/removed easily
- [ ] fix last modified date on Student so it updates when points are added
- [ ] remove Scholar class and make it's attributes part of Grade
- [ ] instead of Grade pointing to a student have the Student class have five grade attributes this is difficult because many things want to iterate over a list of grades
- [ ] have the archive thing import/export plists
- [ ] make the Points constructor create PointCodes if missing
- [ ] in xml make ids of objects attributes instead of child tags e.g. <student student_num=1234>, <grade grade=12>
- [ ] allow search to filter by T1 or T2 averages greater than a value
- [ ] allow students to be kept in the database but marked as inactive so they don't show up in searches or other stuff unless it's explicitly enabled
- [ ] make a button to download pgdb file archive of students and delete them at the same time
- [ ] make sure incorrect inputs from users like files or text don't cause crashes
- [ ] when doing searches avoid python for-loops and properties; try to use sql queries instead
